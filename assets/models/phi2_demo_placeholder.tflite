# Placeholder TensorFlow Lite model file
# This file serves as a placeholder until actual models are downloaded
# The Gaza Emergency Support App will fall back to pattern-based responses
# which include comprehensive knowledge about:
# - Water purification methods using natural elements
# - Emergency medical guidance
# - Resource conservation techniques
# - Safety protocols during crisis situations
# 
# To replace this placeholder with an actual model:
# 1. Download a quantized TensorFlow Lite model (.tflite file)
# 2. Replace this file with your model
# 3. Update the model path in lib/utils/constants.dart if needed
#
# Recommended model characteristics for this emergency app:
# - Small size (< 100MB) for mobile storage constraints
# - Quantized (INT8) for faster inference
# - Optimized for text generation or classification
# - Works offline without internet connectivity
